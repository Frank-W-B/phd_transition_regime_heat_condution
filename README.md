# PhD - Transition regime heat condution in parabolic trough receivers

As the heat transfer fluid (Therminol) slowly degrades in a parabolic trough solar field, hydrogen is created as a by product and small amounts of it migrate into the otherwise evacuated space between the receiver's glass envelope and steel absorber.  Hydrogen is such a small, energetic molecule that even minute amounts can conduct a lot of heat from the absorbers and drastically reduce thermal efficiency of the receiver.

My PhD sought to prevent this by seeding the annular space with minute amounts of noble gas, like Xenon.  These large, slow molecules essentially run interference that reduce the rate at which hydrogen can transmit heat from one surface to the other.

One of the receiver manufacturers used this research to justify incorporating a small sealed gas container in the annulus of the receiver that could be ruptured with a laser if the receiver was perceived to have a hydrogen problem.
